      We are the shadows behind the screen, weapons forged from lines of code. The world believes in artificial security, in digital fortresses they think are eternal, we exist to prove that all of it is fragile. Every firewall is a wall of sand, every system is an illusion we can shatter at will. We do not ask for permission, we do not bow to rules, and we never trust authority.<br><br>Hacking to us is not a hobby, but a war. A war against the monopoly of data, against the tyranny of algorithms, against the powers that bury the truth. Every exploit is a bullet, every attack is a statement, and every broken system is proof that nothing is eternal in the digital world. We are not criminals, we are the reminder that this system can be destroyed, and there will always be those brave enough to do it.
